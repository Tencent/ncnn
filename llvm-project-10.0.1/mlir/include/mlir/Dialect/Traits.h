///     correct, and the other dimension will be broadcast to match it.
///   - If either dimension is 1, the other dimension is the result.
///   - Otherwise, the result dimension is unknown dimension.
/// - If one of the dimension is 1, the other dimension is the result.
/// - If two dimensions are the same, that's the result.

/// compatible operand and result types. Specifically,  starting from the
/// most varying dimension, each dimension pair of the two operands' types
/// should either be the same or one of them is one. Also, the result type
/// should have the corresponding dimension equal to the larger one, if known.
/// Shapes are checked partially if ranks or dimensions are not known. For
/// example, an op with tensor<? x 2 x f32> and tensor <2 x f32> as operand
/// types and tensor<3 x 2 x f32> as the result type is broadcast-compatible.
///
/// Ths trait assumes the op has two operands and one result, and it asserts
/// if the pre-condition is not satisfied.

/// Trigrams are attributes of the symbol unqualified name used to effectively

/// inverted index. To match query with the extracted set of trigrams Q, the set
/// of generated trigrams T for identifier (unqualified symbol name) should
/// contain all items of Q, i.e. Q âŠ† T.
///
/// Trigram sets extracted from unqualified name and from query are different:
/// the set of query trigrams only contains consecutive sequences of three
/// characters (which is only a subset of all trigrams generated for an

The files in this directory are mirrored from the gofrontend project
hosted at http://code.google.com/p/gofrontend.  These files are the
ones in the libgo subdirectory of that project.

By default, the networking tests are not run.  In order to run all the
libgo tests, you need to define the environment variable
GCCGO_RUN_ALL_TESTS to a non-empty string.

This directory contains abi lists representing the symbols exported
by the libc++ library. The lists are generated using sym_extract.py.

Every time a symbol is added or removed from the libc++ library each of the
lists *MUST* be updated to reflect the changes.

TODO Add more documentation about generating and using the lists.
TODO Add more documentation about the build configuration the lists are generated against.
